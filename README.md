This is a test website to host a p5 project that I just recently learned, mostly from Prof. Evan Peck. My p5js editor for this repository [https://editor.p5js.org/xmeng/sketches/2d1U_D7rw]. Below is a screenshot of the program. Note the program actually generates a video the balls bounce back and forth inside a pre-defined screen frame.

I had changed the balls' colors, the text, the text box, and I struggled with trying to change the audio for the program. [ https://hhy002.github.io/BouncingBall/]
