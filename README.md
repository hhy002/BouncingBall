This is a test website to host a p5 prohect that I just recently learned, mostly from Prof. Evan Peck. My p5js editor for this repository [ https://hhy002.github.io/BouncingBall/]. Below is a screenshot of the program. Note the program actually generates a video the balls bounce back and forht inside a pre-defined screen frame.
